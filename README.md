### 3.About this assignment
To make this card, I used basically all I've learned from class. I seperate this card into different parts, which is header, profile, profile image, text and footer. The hardest part for me is how to make the background of the picture "river" to be the right resolution instead of being overmagnificated. I googled some ways but finally I have to rewrite this part from the begining. Luckily in the end I made it.<br>
### Thanks for reading, better to see my card, it looks awsome!
